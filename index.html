            <i><b>“You see, when we label someone as different, it dehumanizes them in a way. They become ‘the other’. They're not worthy of our time, not our problem, and in fact, they, ‘the other’, are probably the cause of our problems.”
                -Mariana Atencio (Tedx University Of Nevada)</b></i><br><br>

          On 24TH August, 2017 the apex court of India finally realised that <b>the Government of a Secular Democratic Socialist Republic Nation cannot deny right of their own bodies or the fundamental human right of privacy to its citizens, the Government has no say in what its citizen does in the privacy of their own property with their consent</b>. Among its varied implications one of them directly affects a largely ignored issue.
<br><br>
          <i><b>LGBTQ rights</b></i>, the one social cause that every instagram celebrity has endorsed by posting a screenshot of the notes app, with a heartfelt open letter written keeping a straight face (pun intended). To put it in simple words, <i><b>India’s law code IPC section 377 is pure bullshit. It literally contradicts the very first page of the constitution that is, the preamble. Imagine being questioned on the first page of the book you have been studying for 70 years and being unable to answer it, Article 377 is something like that.</b></i> The statement given by the previous ruling of SC stated that the LGBTQ community comprised of only a miniscule of the population, so they held up the penal code. <i><b>This is equivalent of saying that if a very small percentage of population thought that putting fried chicken over their waffles was a good idea and the rest of the country thought that it was a morally repulsive idea, the SC could deny fundamental rights to those fried-chicken-over-waffles people. This notion clearly goes against the idea of a welfare state, the foundation on which the constitution was framed.</b></i>
<br><br>
          LGBTQ rights in India have been alienated for a long time now. While the greater world makes progress in protecting the rights of its citizens India falls back in its thinking.<i><b>Outside the protected bubble of Metropolitan citie's upper class, life is not easy for these people.</b></i> Just take the hijra community for an example, the legally recognised third gender. You would see most of these people at traffic signals begging for money, not because they want to but only because they have to. Even having the audacity to apply for a job is commendable in their situation, but the most gruesome part of being different in India is societal respect for merely being a human, the very basic form of the virtue. The best example to offer is the night when the Section 377 was reinstated.<i><b>Laxmi Tripathi</b></i> was on NDTV prime time debating an <i><b>anti gay rights Hindu nationalist</b></i>, it was clear in his body language that he held Laxmi, a trans woman as the lowest form of life undeserving of human respect. He was constantly grinning and had eyes that reflected the devils waiting for his breakfast. It was the most demeaning and dehumanizing look ever produced.<i><b> The activist had guts to stand up against Laxmi on National television, on the night when the State had just empowered people like him to commit heinous hate crimes against people like Laxmi.</b></i>
<br><br>
            <i><b>To the general Indian public LGBTQ rights are non-existent. For them we are the “other”. For them we are not worthy of their time, we are not their problem. But the fact remains that we hold the same rights as any other human being born in this country. It depends on the collective consciousness of the country to grant justice which is not only a few words blotted on paper but also in action and in thought. Change is a gradual process but for the change to occur some form of igniting energy is needed. India does not have its own Marsha P. Johnson, Ellen Degeneres or Harvey Milk but give the people a platform, freedom and encouragement some really inspirational people will surface. Leaders and national icons are not born out of nowhere, it needs a cause and it needs support. We have a cause, only the support of the people is needed.
    <br><br></b></i>
             It is not a question of difference in opinion about a certain way of life but a question of basic human rights.
